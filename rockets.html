        <b>Instructions:</b> <br /><br />
        In the year 2030, SpaceX has mastered interplanetary spaceflight. In this adventure, Elon Musk and his fleet of Falcon Heavy rockets are travelling to a new alien planet. However, the inhabitants of this alien planet are unwelcoming, and have mastered the ability to create black holes around its home planet to deter new visitors.
        <br /><br />The SpaceX Rockets game is a two player game. Here, one player (the aliens) puts three black holes in the gravitational field, while the other player (SpaceX) can fire 5 Falcon Heavy rockets and has to get the closest possible to the alien planet. The last black hole that is placed is a super black hole and increases in size/gravitational pull during each round of SpaceX rocket launches. The final score is a normalized value that captures how close the rockets were to the alien planet. The final score range is [0,100], with 100 representing a rocket that landed on the alien planet, and the decreasing scale from 100 representing how far away the rocket ended up from the alien planet.
