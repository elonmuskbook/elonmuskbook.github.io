                        <li>Early Experiences<br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa to Maye and Errol Musk. He read everything he could get his hands on and retained the information well, having a photographic memory. He experienced a lot of bullying in school, as well as psychological abuse from his father.</li>
                                <li>Musk taught himself to code at age 10; at 12, he wrote a game called Blastar, which sold for $500.</li>
                                <li>He dreamed of going to America to work with computers. Although his parents did not let him, he was set on it. Through his mother’s Canadian citizenship, he got a ticket to Canada at the age of 17. There, he attended Queen's University.</li>
                                <li>Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania on a scholarship in 1992.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li><br />

                        <!-- Obstacles Subsection -->
                        <li>Obstacles
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Press: The public seems to holds the power when it comes to the success of a business. Valleywag, the Silicon Valley gossip site, attacked Musk’s companies many times. Justine Musk, Elon Musk’s ex-wife, detailed their marital problems on her blog and created a nasty version of Musk, which turned the public against him.</li>
                                <li>High Expectations: Elon Musk is known for setting extremely ambitious timelines for his projects, which are often missed. For example, the shipping of the Roadster and Model S kept getting pushed back, and the Falcon launches ended up being several years past scheduled.</li>
                                <li>Power Struggle: There have always been power struggles in his companies, in which Musk competes with someone else to be CEO. This is what got him ousted from PayPal, and what ousted Eberhard (the founder of Tesla) from Tesla. “ ‘He’s a very smart, very driven guy with a huge ego,’ [Dave] Bearden said. ‘[...] He has this belief that he is the guy who can change the world’ ” (103) A lot of drama has occurred, which the press laps up eagerly.</li>
                                <li>Financial Woes: Most, if not all of Musk’s companies have at some point been at extreme lows financially. The worst was probably Tesla, when they nearly drove themselves to bankruptcy missing deadlines and misjudging expenses. “[...] Tesla’s major issue no longer revolved around effort, engineering, or clever marketing. Heading into 2008, the company was running out of money. The Roadster had cost about $140 million to develop, way over the $25 million originally estimated in the 2004 business plan” (179). They were able to pull together just enough funding from investors to survive.</li>

                        </li><br />

                                <li>Founder and former CEO of PayPal (online banking company)</li>
                                <li>Founder and CEO of SpaceX (private-owned rocket company), which successfully launched several rockets and landed them.</li>
                                <li>CEO of Tesla Motors (electric car company), which has released several all-electric cars. Musk oversees the design closely.</li>
                                <li>Provided the idea/funds for SolarCity (solar-powered systems company), former chairman.</li>
                                <li>Provided idea and initial architectural proposal for Hyperloop Technologies</li>

                    <!-- Theme Subsection -->

                    <h3>Theme</h3>
                    <p>One of the most prominent themes of this book is that hard work and determination triumph over the impossible. Elon Musk highly values these traits, and certainly demonstrates this theme through all of his endeavours. At one point in the book, Vance describes a week of Musk’s schedule, which involves flying back and forth across the country to work at both of his companies and appear on talk shows, while also allotting time to his sons. He somehow manages to have a personal life while juggling the CEO position of two major companies in completely different fields. This, obviously, is not an easy task. It is through his extreme work ethic and determination to complete his goal that he is able to achieve this- according to his now ex-wife, Justine Musk, he would often come home from work at 11 and then work some more. His success also has to do with his ability to handle stress, which is one of his distinguishing characteristics. Musk will not bend in a tough circumstance. As said by his friend Jim Ambras, “That’s Elon. Do or die but don’t give up.”

                    <!-- Tone Subsection -->
                    <h3>Tone</h3>
                    <p>Ashlee Vance tried to write this book as unbiased as possible, presenting all sides of the story. Most biographies only focus on the parts favorable to a glorified subject; however, Vance put many hours into interviewing and acquiring the views of many people, not just his or Musk’s alone. While writing this book, Vance said, “{...] I could not let him read the book, for professional, personal, and practical reasons. Musk has his version of the truth, and it’s not always the version of truth that the rest of the world shares” (2). Thus, the author’s tone came off as very truthful.
                    <br /><br />There was also a level of curiosity and thoroughness to the story on the author’s part. In the beginning, Vance described Silicon Valley (and the world’s) fascination with the man who rivaled Steve Jobs in achievements. Vance’s doggedness comes naturally as a reporter. It also originates from when Musk had initially refused to help in writing this book. Going back to the theme, Vance did not stop working on the book and Musk finally gave in, admiring his determination. On this, Vance said, “One thing that Musk holds in the highest regard is resolve, and he respects people who continue on after being told no” (3).

                    <!-- Mood Subsection -->
                    <h3>Mood: Reader</h3>
                    <p>In the book, Musk can often come off as harsh and abrasive- for example, when he fires marketing people who make grammatical mistakes in their emails, or employees that miss an event to witness something like the birth of their child. He holds everyone around him at an extremely high standard and expects them work and think as he does. 
                    <br /><br />One of the first things that I noticed about this book was that Vance does not shy away from this side of Musk. It was a rather jarring realisation, as I expected biographies to generally praise the subject. The openness to imperfection adds a sense of reality, that Musk should not be viewed blindly as saint simply based on his accomplishments. He in fact, can be quite the opposite.
                    <br /><br />This also leads to a point that seems to be communicated- that even though, yes, Elon Musk is a real person, the main point of the book isn’t really about his personality but about what he’s doing for the world. Vance once said, “Musk had somehow delivered the biggest advances the space, automotive, and energy industries had seen in decades in what felt like one fell swoop” (6). He is preparing for the future in ways that have never been tried before, and that is inspiring.

                    </div><br /><br />
                    <p>Elon Musk is all about moving forward. 
                    <br /><br />His companies continue to thrive- testing more rockets, releasing more cars. SpaceX plans to start sending astronauts into space in around 2017. Musk’s dream is to have people colonize Mars, the goal time being around 2040. At Tesla, they recently released an SUV- the Model X. In a few decades, it is very possible that all-electric cars will make up much of the car industry.
                    <br /><br />Aside from working on his companies, Elon Musk is constantly coming up with new ideas and ventures. When he learned about California’s plans to create a high-speed rail for $60 billion, he hated the high construction cost and lack of speed and efficiency. In August 2013, to protest this, he wrote a 57-page paper suggesting a better use of their time and money- a hyperloop. Musk originally wrote it to try to deter the building of the rail, but later started considering building an actual hyperloop after the idea was well received by the public. Hyperloop Technologies has since then been founded. <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2016/01/08/the-first-hyperloop-tubes-are-already-in-the-desert/" target="_blank">Construction for testing has already begun</a>.
                    <br /><br />Another one of his wild ideas is to surround the Earth with tiny satellites to provide high speed internet everywhere, including undeveloped and isolated areas. It may sound out there, but many have accepted Musk’s ability to both talk and deliver. 
                    <br /><br />As always, the future remains uncertain. But it is definite that Elon Musk will certainly play a big part in it.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote name="bee5" id="bee5" class="graf--blockquote graf-after--p">“I’m also more convinced that Musk is a deeply emotional person who suffers and rejoices in an epic fashion. This side of him is likely obscured by the fact that he feels most deeply about his own humanity-altering quest and so has trouble recognizing the strong emotions of those around him. This tends to make Musk come off as aloof and hard. I would argue, however, that his brand of empathy is unique. He seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals. And it may well be the case that this is exactly the type of person it takes to make a freaking space Internet real.” - Ashlee Vance</blockquote>
